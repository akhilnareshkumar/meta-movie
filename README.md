# Meta-Movie

Meta-movie fetches information about the movies in your collection. Sort your movies according to ratings. No need to painstakingly look up each movie.

### Why though?
You have a big collection of movies. Whenever you decide to watch a movie, youI have to look up each movie for the ratings. You always watch the best rated movie in your db. You borrowed your friend's HDD, you'll run this app to find the best movies in it.

### Cool, how to use this?
Works on Linux. Not tested on Windows and Mac yet.
* Put the pathname of your movies folder in 'meta_movie.py'
* Run the python code, `python meta-movie.py`
* Install uninstalled python packages if any, using pip, `sudo -H pip install <python-package-name>`
