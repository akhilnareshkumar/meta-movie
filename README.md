# Meta-Movie

Meta-movie fetches information about the movies in your collection. Sorts your movies according to ratings. No need to painstakingly look up each movie.

### Why though?
* You have a big collection of movies. Whenever you decide to watch a movie, you have to look up each movie for the ratings. You always watch the best rated movie in your db.
* You borrowed your friend's HDD, you need to find which are the best movies he/she has.

### Cool, how to use this?
Works on Linux for now. Not tested on Windows and Mac yet.
* Install dependencies if any, using pip, `sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run this on the terminal: `python meta-movie.py path/to/the/movies/folder/`
